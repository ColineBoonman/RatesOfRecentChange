###Meta data
All prioritization lists include two columns.
1. Scientific species names 
2. IUCN Red List conservation status groups

The IUCN Red List statuses presented in the prioritization lists are the conservation status groups created in this study. They are lumped speciesâ€™ original IUCN Red List statuses (retrieved on the 12th of January 2023) combining:
- LC, NT, LR/lc and LR/nt into Not threatened
- VU into Vulnerable
- EX, EW, RE, CR, EN and LR/cd into Threatened. 
 
Additionally, DD stands for Data Deficient and species that were not listed on the IUCN Red List were given the status Not Evaluated.
