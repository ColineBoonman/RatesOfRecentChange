### Meta data
The .txt file contains all processed data used in this study, and is saved with comma seperator, dot decimal, including header. Each row (n=34827) is a species and each column (n=26) contains different information. For all columns identified by 'slope', the mblm slopes are set to 0 when p-value >0.05. The IUCN statuses as provided here are a recategorized from the official IUCN statuses, as follows: 
"LR/lc" "LR/nt" "LR/cd" "NT"  "LC" = "NotThreatened", "CR" "EN" "EW" "EX" = "Threatened", "VU" = "Vulnerable", "DD" = "DD" (where DD stands for data deficient), no data = "NotEvaluated".
